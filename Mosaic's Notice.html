    <h3><font color="#1822CD">What is Mosaic?</font></h3>
     Mosaic creates a mosaic reproduction of any picture using frames captured live from your TV input card.
     <p>Here is an example picture below. The left part is the source image, the right part, the reconstructed image
     using random TV frames (clic on the image to see it at its normal size).
    <p><center>
      <a href="Example.png"><IMG SRC="Example.png" ALT="Mosaic Example" WIDTH="512" HEIGHT="335" BORDER="2"><a>
    </center></p>
 
     <br>The goal is purely artistic. Try it on different type of images, with different TV programs.
     Let the program work for long for better results.

 	<h3><font color="#1822CD">Requirement</font></h3>
 	For obvious reasons, you will need a TV capture card supported by BeOS R5 (with or without third party drivers).
 	<br>It is not required, but it will be handy for you to also have <a href="http://www.bebits.com/app/907">stampTV</a>
 	to create TV channel presets.
 	<h3><font color="#1822CD">Who is the author?</font></h3>
	Mosaic was first written by <a href="mailto:frank@diematie.sun.ac.za">Frank Olivier</a>, who made the source public.
	Because he of his studies (that's what he says... :-), he didn't have the time to make more
	improvements to the original version, so when I sent him back some improvements, he immediately
	requested that I take over the program.
	<br>Since the first version, the main algorithm hasn't changed much in what it does, but has quite
	evolved in the way it does it. I have mainly worked on the user interface.
	
	<h3><font color="#1822CD">How does it work?</font></h3>
	Select an image that you want to reproduce with as a mosaic, and select "Start Processing", and wait that
	the result image pleases you. Then select "Save" to save that result image on your disk!

    <p>Here is a quick overview of Mosaic's features as found in the menu bar:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><font color="#1822CD"><b><i>Open Source Image...</i></b></font>
      <br>
      Opens a file selector to allow you to select the image you want to reproduce.
      You can also simple drag'n drop an image on Mosaic's main window.
	</li>
      <li><font color="#1822CD"><b><i>Reload Source Image</i></b></font>
      <br>You can apply some filtering effects to the source image, therefore, you may want to revert to the original
      picture. This item does just that.</li>

      <li><font color="#1822CD"><b><i>Select Result Image...</i></b></font>
      <br>You can resume work on an image: for that, first select the original image with the previous methods, then use
      this menu item to select the resulting image you want to continue to work on.
      <br>You can also drag'n drop a result image directly in the window. If some source image is already loaded, then
      if the dragged image has the same size as the source image, you will be able to tell if the newly dragged image should be
      used as a source image or as a result image to continue.</li>

      <li><font color="#1822CD"><b><i>Reload result image</i></b></font>
      <br>You can also apply some filters to the result image, or you may want simply to revert to the result image
      which is stored on your disk. Use this option then.</li>

      <li><font color="#1822CD"><b><i>Start Processing/Stop Processing</i></b></font>
      <br>Those options are self explanatory.</li>

      <li><font color="#1822CD"><b><i>Save Result/Save Result As.../Quit</i></b></font>
      <br>Do what you'd expect...</li>

      <li><font color="#1822CD"><b><i>View Source/View Result</i></b></font>
      <br>Select which image you want to see.</li>

      <li><font color="#1822CD"><b><i>Blur this Image just a Little/Blur this Image/Blur this Image More</i></b></font>
      <br>Will apply some blurring effect to the image currently displayed. You can't undo this operation,
      but files on disk are not touched. In other words, if your image is not saved on disk, you won't be able
      to recover the original image...
      <br>Blurring the source image might help Mosaic a little bit, while blurring the result image will help
      remove the unpleasant edges of the mosaic. It is a taste question, to use it if/how you wish!</li>

      <li><font color="#1822CD"><b><i>Monitor</i></b></font>
      <br>Will allow to show/hide a monitor window showing the current TV image captured. Note that this image is the
      pure video source from which is extracted the picture that will be used. That extracted picture is usually much
      smaller, with possibly blur effects & cut borders.
      <br>It will help you to select the best TV program for your work.</li>

      <li><i><font color="red">If you have used</font></i> <a href="http://www.bebits.com/app/907">stampTV</a>
      <i><font color="red">to create named channel presets</font></i>, then you will have more useful
      menu items in the TV menu. The presets read from stampTV's preference file will be made available allowing
      you to change TV channel while working. The shortcuts Alt-'+' and Alt-'-' will allow you to change the channel quickly.
      </li>
      
      <li><font color="#1822CD"><b><i>Clic on any part of the result image</i></b></font>
      <br>That will tell Mosaic that you are not happy with the frame you have selected, and Mosaic will replace it
      with some other frame.
      </li>

      <li>That's it!</li>
    </ul>

    <h3><font color="#1822CD">Known bugs &amp; problems</font></h3>

    <ul>
      <li>If you can't select the image sizes, or which section of the TV image will extracted, or
      which algorithm will be used without editing the source code and recompiling the program.</li>
    </ul>
